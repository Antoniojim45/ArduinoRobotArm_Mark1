# ArduinoRobotArm_Mark1
## Goal: 
the goal of this project is to create a robotic arm that will be able to hold PCBs and remotely move to different positions. 

## Introduction:
Since the robot arm is one of the most common projects among engineering students, I wanted to try this project out for myself. in creating a robotic arm, I didn't just want to create this project just for the sake of making it and forgetting about it in the future, I wanted to create this project so that it can serve a purpose in the future. one of purposes is mainly to learn from the code and the engineering of the robotic arm, the next purpose is to have it a tool to utilize when doing other projects. 

## in this repository:
-I will be posting a paper report on the project.

-I will be posting updated versions of the code.

-I will show the drawn schematics of the electronics.

-I will provide the STL files and the Fusion 360 files.

-I will provide the sources used to create the robotic arm.

-I will create and post videos and images of the project and its progress.
